## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ! ![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=jeremieP.visitor-badge&left_text=You%20are%20visitor%20number)

I'm *JÃ©rÃ©mie Pereira*, I'm currently working as a Frontend Architect & Tech Evangelist for the french classified ad website [leboncoin.fr](https://www.leboncoin.fr).

Loving and crafting the web since around 20 years now, my main interests are sharing my knowledge, learn about new web things every day, and I'm passionated by Web Performance.

I am the proud dad of a little boy named Rafael, I live near Paris, and I love basket-ball _(Shaq is my favourite player even he's retired)_ and video games _(Kratos & Cloud are my favorite characters)_ and I collect all the Playstation trophies I can on my profile !
